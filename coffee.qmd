Under the apprenticeship of the 2024 United States Barista Champion - Frank La, I continue to develop my passion for coffee through roasting, pouring latte art, hosting my own popups, and documenting the Los Angeles cafe scene.

# Be Bright Coffee

After asking for an apprenticeship in Summer 2023, I began to work at Be Bright as their production Roaster. I learned how to roast on a Loring Kestrel S35, and utilize Cropster Roasting Intelligence for quality control, monitoring roasts, and green coffee inventory. In addition, I navigate Roastertools for production order, and connecting to our wholesale portals.

# 757 Coffee and Matcha

What was first a small gathering of friends in Sproul Landing 757, quickly turned into regular popups. After moving into an apartment, 757 became a famous apartment popup for those in the UCLA community, boasting high quality specialty drinks and maxed out RSVP slots.

# Upside Down

I would not be at this place in my coffee journey if it were not for Upside Down in Westwood. It was here I learned not only the basics of barista-ing, but also how to have exceptional hospitality and the importance of creating a space of gathering for a community.
