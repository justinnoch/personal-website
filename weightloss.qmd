# Introduction
## Question of Interest
As a barista and coffee enthusiast, I explored the impact of roasting variables on coffee weight loss. Green coffee contains **10-12% moisture**, which is lost during roasting. This study aims to determine:

- **Which roasting variables have the strongest correlation with weight loss?**
- **Which model best describes this relationship?**

## Data Collection
- **Source:** Esh Coffee, a small microroaster in Los Angeles.
- **Roaster Used:** Aillio Bullet R1 V2.
- **Sample Size:** 100 roast profiles extracted from **Roast World**.

# Methodology
## Variables
- **Response Variable:** Weight Loss % = (1 - Roasted Weight / Green Weight)
- **Explanatory Variables:**
  - **End Time** (Total Roast Time in minutes)
  - **End IBTS** (End Infrared Bean Temperature Sensor, °C)
  - **MASL** (Meters Above Sea Level where coffee was grown)
  - **Development %** (Time after first crack / total roast time)

# Data Analysis

## Descriptive Statistics

| Variable        | Mean   | Std Dev | Correlation With Weight Loss |
|---------------|--------|---------|-------------------------------|
| End Time      | 11.82  | 1.45    | 0.19                          |
| End IBTS      | 201.84 | 4.83    | 0.75                          |
| MASL          | 1832   | 184.06  | -0.44                         |
| Development % | 16.99  | 2.96    | 0.15                          |

- **End IBTS (r = 0.75)** shows the strongest correlation with weight loss.
- **MASL (r = -0.44)** indicates a weak **negative** correlation.
- **End Time & Development %** show weak relationships.

## Linear Regression Model

| Predictor  | Estimate  | Std. Error | t Value | p-Value   |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|
| Intercept  | -12.36    | 3.05        | -6.28   | 9.72e-09  |
| End Time   | 0.015     | 0.046       | 4.07    | 9.71e-05  |
| End IBTS   | 0.143     | 0.014       | 12.13   | <2e-16    |
| MASL       | -0.0028   | 0.0004      | -6.03   | 3.00e-08  |

- **End IBTS (p < 2e-16) and MASL (p = 3.00e-08) are significant predictors.**
- **Development % is not significant (p = 0.548) and was removed from the model.**

### Final Regression Equation:
$$\text{Predicted Loss} = -12.36 + 0.015(\text{End Time}) + 0.143(\text{End IBTS}) - 0.0028(\text{MASL})$$

## Model Comparison
We compared different models, including **No-Outlier and Log-Transformed Models**.

| Model             | Adjusted R² | VIF < 5? |
|------------------|-------------|----------|
| Full Model       | 0.6976      | Yes      |
| Reduced Model    | 0.6996      | Yes      |
| No-Outlier Model | **0.7203**  | Yes      |
| Log Model        | 0.6802      | Yes      |

- **No-Outlier Model performed best (Adjusted R² = 0.7203).**

# Conclusion
- **End IBTS and MASL are strong predictors of weight loss.**
- **The No-Outlier Model provided the best fit.**
- **Future studies** could analyze moisture levels, processing methods, and drum capacity for deeper insights.
