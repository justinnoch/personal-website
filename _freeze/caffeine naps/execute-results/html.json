This study examines whether caffeine and naps improve attention span. Using a **Two-Way Randomized Block Design** and **two-way ANOVA**, we analyzed a sample of islanders. Our results indicate that **Nap Interval significantly affects attention span**, while caffeine consumption and gender do not.\n\n# Introduction\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant found in coffee, tea, and other sources, known to increase alertness. Studies suggest that:\n\n-   **Caffeine doses of 75 mg or more** impact attention (EFSA).\n-   **Short naps of up to 30 minutes** can enhance alertness (CDC).\n-   **“Caffeine naps” (caffeine before napping)** may improve focus (Centofanti et al.).\n\nThis study investigates the **combined effects of caffeine and naps** using **water, coffee, and tea** as caffeine sources and **0, 30, and 60-minute naps** as treatments.\n\n# Experiment Design & Methods\n\n## Participants\n\n-   **198 participants** (99 males, 99 females) from \"The Islands\" virtual program.\n-   Randomly assigned into equal-sized treatment groups.\n\n## Study Design\n\n-   **Blocking Variable:** Gender\n-   **Factors:** Nap Duration (0, 30, 60 minutes), Caffeine Type (Water, Tea, Coffee)\n-   **Response Variable:** Attention Score (difference before and after treatment)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Nap_Duration |Caffeine |\n|:------------|:--------|\n|0 min        |Water    |\n|0 min        |Tea      |\n|0 min        |Coffee   |\n|30 min       |Water    |\n|30 min       |Tea      |\n|30 min       |Coffee   |\n|60 min       |Water    |\n|60 min       |Tea      |\n|60 min       |Coffee   |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Procedure\n\n1.  Recruit 198 participants, ensuring equal gender distribution.\n2.  Randomly assign them to the 9 treatment groups.\n3.  Conduct a **baseline attention test**.\n4.  Administer assigned **nap durations and caffeine treatments**.\n5.  Wait **15 minutes** after treatment.\n6.  Conduct a **post-treatment attention test**.\n7.  Calculate the **difference in attention scores**.\n\n# Results\n\n## Box Plots\n\nThe boxplots below show the distribution of attention score differences by Nap Interval and Caffeine Type:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](caffeine-naps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## ANOVA Results\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Factor                   | p_value|\n|:------------------------|-------:|\n|Gender                   |  0.7586|\n|Nap Interval             |  0.0186|\n|Caffeine                 |  0.6757|\n|Nap:Caffeine Interaction |  0.1103|\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   **Nap Interval (p = 0.0186)** was the only significant factor.\n-   **Caffeine and Gender** had no significant effect.\n-   **No interaction effect** was detected between Caffeine and Nap Interval.\n\n## Tukey HSD Test for Nap Duration\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Comparison       | Difference| p_value|\n|:----------------|----------:|-------:|\n|30 min vs 0 min  |       2.23|   0.017|\n|60 min vs 0 min  |       1.59|   0.120|\n|60 min vs 30 min |      -0.64|   0.709|\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   **30-minute naps** significantly improved attention compared to no naps (**p = 0.017**).\n-   **60-minute naps** did not significantly differ from 0 or 30-minute naps.\n\n## Residual Diagnostics\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](caffeine-naps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   **Residual plots confirm model assumptions** of normality and homogeneity of variance.\n\n# Discussion\n\n-   **Napping was a significant factor**, while **caffeine had no measurable impact**.\n-   The study could be improved by adding a **placebo group** (e.g., decaf coffee).\n-   Future studies could investigate **caffeine naps** (caffeine before napping).\n-   Effects of **energy drinks with sugar** should be explored.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTaking a **30-minute nap significantly improves attention**, whereas **caffeine does not show measurable effects**. However, caffeine is not harmful in moderate doses.\n\n# References\n\n-   [CDC: Caffeine and Long Work Hours](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/emres/longhourstraining/caffeine.html)\n-   Centofanti et al.
